* Give examples of monosaccharides and polysaccharides
* Describe the function of monosaccharides and polysaccharides within a cell

The most abundant biomolecules on earth are **carbohydrate**{: data-type="term"}**s**. From a chemical viewpoint, carbohydrates are primarily a combination of carbon and water, and many of them have the empirical formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>, where *n* is the number of repeated units. This view represents these molecules simply as “hydrated” carbon atom chains in which water molecules attach to each carbon atom, leading to the term “carbohydrates.” Although all carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, there are some that also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur. Carbohydrates have myriad different functions. They are abundant in terrestrial ecosystems, many forms of which we use as food sources. These molecules are also vital parts of macromolecular structures that store and transmit genetic information (i.e., DNA and RNA). They are the basis of biological polymers that impart strength to various structural components of organisms (e.g., cellulose and chitin), and they are the primary source of energy storage in the form of starch and glycogen.

### Monosaccharides: The Sweet Ones

In biochemistry, carbohydrates are often called **saccharide**{: data-type="term"}**s**, from the Greek *sakcharon*, meaning sugar, although not all the saccharides are sweet. The simplest carbohydrates are called **monosaccharide**{: data-type="term"}**s**, or simple sugars. They are the building blocks (monomers) for the synthesis of polymers or complex carbohydrates, as will be discussed further in this section. Monosaccharides are classified based on the number of carbons in the molecule. General categories are identified using a prefix that indicates the number of carbons and the suffix –*ose*, which indicates a saccharide; for example, triose (three carbons), tetrose (four carbons), pentose (five carbons), and hexose (six carbons) ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_07_02_monosacch)). The hexose D-glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide in nature. Other very common and abundant hexose monosaccharides are **galactose**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, used to make the disaccharide milk sugar **lactose**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, and the fruit sugar **fructose**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}.

 ![Diagrams of various monosaccharides. Glyceraldehyde is an aldose because it has a double bonded O attached to an end carbon. Dihydroxyacetone is a ketose because it has a double bonded O attached in the center of the chain. Glyceraldehyde is a triose because it has 3 carbons. Ribose is a pentose because it has 5 carbons. Glucose is a hexose because it has 6 carbons.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_07_02_monosacch.jpg "Monosaccharides are classified based on the position of the carbonyl group and the number of carbons in the backbone."){: #OSC_Microbio_07_02_monosacch}

Monosaccharides of four or more carbon atoms are typically more stable when they adopt cyclic, or ring, structures. These ring structures result from a chemical reaction between functional groups on opposite ends of the sugar’s flexible carbon chain, namely the carbonyl group and a relatively distant hydroxyl group. Glucose, for example, forms a six-membered ring ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_07_02_cyclicMon)).

 ![a) a diagram showing how a linear carbohydrate forms a ring. Glucose has 6 carbons; Carbon 1 has a double bonded O. Carbon 5 has an OH group. After the ring forms, Carbon 1 is attached to the O with a single bond and this O is now also attached to carbon 5. B) shows the final structure which is a hexagon shape. The top right corner is an O, the next 5 corners are Cs and the C at the top left is attached to another C that projects upward from the ring.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_07_02_cyclicMon.jpg "(a) A linear monosaccharide (glucose in this case) forms a cyclic structure. (b) This illustration shows a more realistic depiction of the cyclic monosaccharide structure.

### Disaccharides

Two monosaccharide molecules may chemically bond to form a **disaccharide**{: data-type="term"}. The name given to the covalent bond between the two monosaccharides is a **glycosidic bond**{: data-type="term"}. Glycosidic bonds form between hydroxyl groups of the two **saccharide**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} molecules, an example of the **dehydration synthesis**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} described in the previous section of this chapter:

</div>

Common disaccharides are the grain sugar **maltose**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, made of two glucose molecules; the milk sugar **lactose**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, made of a **galactose**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and a **glucose**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} molecule; and the table sugar **sucrose**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, made of a glucose and a fructose molecule ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_07_02_disacchar)).

 ![Maltose is made of 2 glucose molecules linked with O from Carbon 4 of one glucose to carbon 1 of the other. Lactose is made of a glucose linked to a galactose. Carbon 4 of glucose is linked to carbon 1 of galactose. Sucrose is made of a glucose and a fructose. Carbon 1 of glucose is bound to carbon 2 of fructose.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_07_02_disacchar.jpg "Common disaccharides include maltose, lactose, and sucrose."){: #OSC_Microbio_07_02_disacchar}

### Polysaccharides

Polysaccharides, also called **glycans**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, are large polymers composed of hundreds of monosaccharide monomers. Unlike mono- and disaccharides, **polysaccharides**{: data-type="term"} are not sweet and, in general, they are not soluble in water. Like disaccharides, the monomeric units of polysaccharides are linked together by **glycosidic bond**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}s.

Polysaccharides are very diverse in their structure. Three of the most biologically important polysaccharides—**starch**{: data-type="term"}, **glycogen**{: data-type="term"}, and **cellulose**{: data-type="term"}—are all composed of repetitive glucose units, although they differ in their structure ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_07_02_polysacch)). Cellulose consists of a linear chain of glucose molecules and is a common structural component of cell walls in plants and other organisms. Glycogen and starch are branched polymers; glycogen is the primary energy-storage molecule in animals and bacteria, whereas plants primarily store energy in starch. The orientation of the **glycosidic linkage**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}s in these three polymers is different as well and, as a consequence, linear and branched macromolecules have different properties.

Modified **glucose**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} molecules can be fundamental components of other structural **polysaccharide**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}s. Examples of these types of structural polysaccharides are N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) and N-acetyl muramic acid (NAM) found in bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. Polymers of NAG form **chitin**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, which is found in fungal cell walls and in the exoskeleton of insects.

 ![Amylose is a chain of hexagons. Starch is a branching chain of hexagons. Glycogen is a highly branching chain of hexagons. Cellulose (fiber) is many rows of hexagons attached into a flat square. Micrographs of starch look like water bubbles, glycogen look like ovals, and cellulose look like long strands.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_07_02_polysacch.jpg "Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are three of the most important polysaccharides.

### Key Concepts and Summary

* **Carbohydrates**, the most abundant biomolecules on earth, are widely used by organisms for structural and energy-storage purposes.
* Carbohydrates include individual sugar molecules (**monosaccharides**) as well as two or more molecules chemically linked by **glycosidic bonds**. **Monosaccharides** are classified based on the number of carbons the molecule as trioses (3 C), tetroses (4 C), pentoses (5 C), and hexoses (6 C). They are the building blocks for the synthesis of polymers or complex carbohydrates.
* **Disaccharides** such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose are molecules composed of two monosaccharides linked together by a glycosidic bond.
* **Polysaccharides**, or **glycans**, are polymers composed of hundreds of monosaccharide monomers linked together by glycosidic bonds. The energy-storage polymers **starch** and **glycogen** are examples of polysaccharides and are all composed of branched chains of glucose molecules.
* The polysaccharide **cellulose** is a common structural component of the cell walls of organisms. Other structural polysaccharides, such as N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) and N-acetyl muramic acid (NAM), incorporate modified glucose molecules and are used in the construction of peptidoglycan or chitin.
