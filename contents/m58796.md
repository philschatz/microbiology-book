### Learning Objectives

* Describe the unique features of each class within the phylum Proteobacteria: Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Epsilonproteobacteria
* Give an example of a bacterium in each class of Proteobacteria

In 1987, the American microbiologist Carl **Woese**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} (1928–2012) suggested that a large and diverse group of bacteria that he called “purple bacteria and their relatives” should be defined as a separate phylum within the domain **Bacteria**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} based on the similarity of the nucleotide sequences in their genome.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="footnote-ref1">[1](#footnote1){: data-type="footnote-link"}</sup> This phylum of gram-negative bacteria subsequently received the name **Proteobacteria**{: data-type="term"}. It includes many bacteria that are part of the normal human microbiota as well as many pathogens. The Proteobacteria are further divided into five classes: Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Epsilonproteobacteria ([Appendix D](/m58949){: .target-chapter}).

### Alphaproteobacteria

The first class of Proteobacteria is the **Alphaproteobacteria**{: data-type="term"}. The unifying characteristic of this class is that they are **oligotroph**{: data-type="term"}s, organisms capable of living in low-nutrient environments such as deep oceanic sediments, glacial ice, or deep undersurface soil.

Among the Alphaproteobacteria are two taxa, chlamydias and rickettsias, that are **obligate intracellular pathogen**{: data-type="term"}s, meaning that part of their life cycle must occur inside other cells called host cells. When not growing inside a host cell, ***Chlamydia***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and ***Rickettsia***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} are metabolically inactive outside of the host cell. They cannot synthesize their own adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and, therefore, rely on cells for their energy needs.

*Rickettsia* spp. include a number of serious human pathogens. For example, ***R. rickettsii***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} causes **Rocky Mountain spotted fever**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, a life-threatening form of meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the membranes that wrap the brain). *R. rickettsii* infects ticks and can be transmitted to humans via a bite from an infected tick ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_04_02_RRicketsii)).

 ![A micrograph of blue cells labeled tick hemolymph cells. Inside of these cells are small red cells labeled R. rickettsia.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_04_02_RRicketsii.jpg "Rickettsias require special staining methods to see them under a microscope. Here, R. rickettsii, which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, is shown infecting the cells of a tick. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)"){: #OSC_Microbio_04_02_RRicketsii}

Another species of *Rickettsia*, *R.* *prowazekii*, is spread by lice. It causes **epidemic typhus**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, a severe infectious disease common during warfare and mass migrations of people. *R. prowazekii* infects human endothelium cells, causing inflammation of the inner lining of blood vessels, high fever, abdominal pain, and sometimes delirium. A relative, *R. typhi*, causes a less severe disease known as murine or endemic typhus, which is still observed in the southwestern United States during warm seasons.

*Chlamydia* is another taxon of the Alphaproteobacteria. Members of this genus are gram-negative, obligate intracellular pathogens that are extremely resistant to the cellular defenses, giving them the ability to spread from host to host rapidly via elementary bodies. The metabolically and reproductively inactive **elementary bodies**{: data-type="term"} are the endospore-like form of intracellular bacteria that enter an epithelial cell, where they become active. [\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_04_02_Chlamydia) illustrates the life cycle of *Chlamydia*.

*C. trachomatis* is a human pathogen that causes **trachoma**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, a disease of the eyes, often leading to blindness. *C. trachomatis* also causes the sexually transmitted disease **lymphogranuloma venereum**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} (LGV). This disease is often mildly symptomatic, manifesting as regional lymph node swelling, or it may be asymptomatic, but it is extremely contagious and is common on college campuses.

 ![A diagram showing the life cycle of Chlamydia. An epithelial cell is infected by small spheres labeldd elementary bodies. Within 12 hours, these form into reticulate bodies which divide  to form inclusions within 24 hours. Within the inclusions more elementary bodies are formed and within 72 hours these are released when the cell ruptures.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_04_02_Chlamydia.jpg "Chlamydia begins infection of a host when the metabolically inactive elementary bodies enter an epithelial cell. Once inside the host cell, the elementary bodies turn into active reticulate bodies. The reticulate bodies multiply and release more elementary bodies when the cell dies after the Chlamydia uses all of the host cell&#x2019;s ATP.

### Betaproteobacteria

Unlike Alphaproteobacteria, which survive on a minimal amount of nutrients, the class **Betaproteobacteria**{: data-type="term"} are **eutroph**{: data-type="term"}s (or copiotrophs), meaning that they require a copious amount of organic nutrients. Betaproteobacteria often grow between aerobic and anaerobic areas (e.g., in mammalian intestines). Some genera include species that are human pathogens, able to cause severe, sometimes life-threatening disease. The genus ***Neisseria***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, for example, includes the bacteria *N. gonorrhoeae,* the causative agent of the STI **gonorrhea**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, and *N. meningitides*, the causative agent of **bacterial meningitis**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}.

*Neisseria* are cocci that live on mucosal surfaces of the human body. They are fastidious, or difficult to culture, and they require high levels of moisture, nutrient supplements, and carbon dioxide. Also, *Neisseria* are microaerophilic, meaning that they require low levels of oxygen. For optimal growth and for the purposes of identification, *Neisseria* spp. are grown on chocolate agar (i.e., agar supplemented by partially hemolyzed red blood cells). Their characteristic pattern of growth in culture is diplococcal: pairs of cells resembling coffee beans ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_04_02_Neisseria)).

 ![A photograph showing round domes on a brown background.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_04_02_Neisseria.jpg "Neisseria meningitidis growing in colonies on a chocolate agar plate. (credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)"){: #OSC_Microbio_04_02_Neisseria}

The pathogen responsible for **pertussis**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} (**whooping cough**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}) is also a member of Betaproteobacteria. The bacterium ***Bordetella pertussis***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, from the order **Burkholderiales**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, produces several toxins that paralyze the movement of cilia in the human respiratory tract and directly damage cells of the respiratory tract, causing a severe cough.

When Marsha finally went to the doctor’s office, the physician listened to her breathing through a stethoscope. He heard some crepitation (a crackling sound) in her lungs, so he ordered a chest radiograph and asked the nurse to collect a sputum sample for microbiological evaluation and cytology. The radiologic evaluation found cavities, opacities, and a particular pattern of distribution of abnormal material ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_04_02_Xray)).

</div>

### Gammaproteobacteria

The most diverse class of **gram-negative bacteria**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} is **Gammaproteobacteria**{: data-type="term"}, and it includes a number of human pathogens. For example, a large and diverse family, *Pseudomonaceae*, includes the genus ***Pseudomonas***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. Within this genus is the species *P. aeruginosa*, a pathogen responsible for diverse infections in various regions of the body. *P. aeruginosa* is a strictly aerobic, nonfermenting, highly motile bacterium. It often infects wounds and burns, can be the cause of chronic urinary tract infections, and can be an important cause of respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis or patients on mechanical ventilators. Infections by *P. aeruginosa* are often difficult to treat because the bacterium is resistant to many antibiotics and has a remarkable ability to form biofilms. Other representatives of *Pseudomonas* include the fluorescent (glowing) bacterium *P. fluorescens* and the soil bacteria *P. putida*, which is known for its ability to degrade **xenobiotics**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} (substances not naturally produced or found in living organisms).

The ***Pasteurellaceae***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} also includes several clinically relevant genera and species. This family includes several bacteria that are human and/or animal pathogens. For example, *Pasteurella haemolytica* causes severe pneumonia in sheep and goats. *P. multocida* is a species that can be transmitted from animals to humans through bites, causing infections of the skin and deeper tissues. The genus ***Haemophilus***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} contains two human pathogens, *H. influenzae* and *H. ducreyi*. Despite its name, *H. influenzae* does not cause influenza (which is a viral disease). *H. influenzae* can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, ear infections, and pneumonia. Before the development of effective vaccination, strains of *H. influenzae* were a leading cause of more invasive diseases, like **meningitis**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} in children. *H. ducreyi* causes the STI known as **chancroid**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}.

The order **Vibrionales**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} includes the human pathogen ***Vibrio cholerae***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. This comma-shaped aquatic bacterium thrives in highly alkaline environments like shallow lagoons and sea ports. A toxin produced by *V. cholerae* causes hypersecretion of electrolytes and water in the large intestine, leading to profuse watery diarrhea and dehydration. *V. parahaemolyticus* is also a cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans, whereas *V. vulnificus* causes serious and potentially life-threatening cellulitis (infection of the skin and deeper tissues) and blood-borne infections. Another representative of Vibrionales, *Aliivibrio fischeri*, engages in a symbiotic relationship with squid. The squid provides nutrients for the bacteria to grow and the bacteria produce **bioluminescence**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} that protects the squid from predators ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_04_02_vibrionale)).

 ![a) A photograph of shining green dots on a black backround. B) A photograph of a glowing squid.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_04_02_vibrionale.jpg "(a) Aliivibrio fischeri is a bioluminescent bacterium. (b) A. fischeri colonizes and lives in a mutualistic relationship with the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes). (credit a: modification of work by American Society for Microbiology; credit b: modification of work by Margaret McFall-Ngai)"){: #OSC_Microbio_04_02_vibrionale}

The genus ***Legionella***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} also belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria. *L. pneumophila,* the pathogen responsible for **Legionnaires disease**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, is an aquatic bacterium that tends to inhabit pools of warm water, such as those found in the tanks of air conditioning units in large buildings ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_04_02_Legionella)). Because the bacteria can spread in aerosols, outbreaks of Legionnaires disease often affect residents of a building in which the water has become contaminated with *Legionella.* In fact, these bacteria derive their name from the first known outbreak of Legionnaires disease, which occurred in a hotel hosting an American Legion veterans’ association convention in Philadelphia in 1976.

B) A photograph of an air conditioner.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_04_02_Legionella.jpg "(a) Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires disease, thrives in warm water.

(credit a: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)"){: #OSC_Microbio_04_02_Legionella}

**Enterobacteriaceae**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} is a large family of **enteric**{: data-type="term"} (intestinal) bacteria belonging to the **Gammaproteobacteria**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. They are facultative anaerobes and are able to ferment carbohydrates. Within this family, microbiologists recognize two distinct categories. The first category is called the coliforms, after its prototypical bacterium species, ***Escherichia coli***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. **Coliforms**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} are able to ferment lactose completely (i.e., with the production of acid and gas). The second category, **noncoliforms**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, either cannot ferment lactose or can only ferment it incompletely (producing either acid or gas, but not both). The noncoliforms include some notable human pathogens, such as *Salmonella* spp*., Shigella* spp*.,* and ***Yersinia pestis***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}.

*E. coli* has been perhaps the most studied bacterium since it was first described in 1886 by Theodor Escherich (1857–1911). Many strains of E. coli are in mutualistic relationships with humans. However, some strains produce a potentially deadly toxin called Shiga toxin. Shiga toxin is one of the most potent bacterial toxins identified. Upon entering target cells, Shiga toxin interacts with ribosomes, stopping protein synthesis. Lack of protein synthesis leads to cellular death and hemorrhagic colitis, characterized by inflammation of intestinal tract and bloody diarrhea. In the most severe cases, patients can develop a deadly hemolytic uremic syndrome. Other E. coli strains may cause traveler’s diarrhea, a less severe but very widespread disease.

The genus ***Salmonella***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, which belongs to the noncoliform group of *Enterobacteriaceae*, is interesting in that there is still no consensus about how many species it includes. Scientists have reclassified many of the groups they once thought to be species as **serotypes**{: data-type="term"} (also called **serovars**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}), which are strains or variations of the same species of bacteria. Their classification is based on patterns of reactivity by animal antisera against molecules on the surface of the bacterial cells. A number of serotypes of *Salmonella* can cause **salmonellosis**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, characterized by inflammation of the small and the large intestine, accompanied by fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The species *S. enterobacterica* (serovar *typhi*) causes **typhoid fever**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, with symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, and skin rashes ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_04_02_Salmonella)).

</div>

### Deltaproteobacteria

The **Deltaproteobacteria**{: data-type="term"} is a small class of gram-negative **Proteobacteria**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} that includes **sulfate-reducing bacteria**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} (SRBs), so named because they use sulfate as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. Few SRBs are pathogenic. However, the SRB *Desulfovibrio orale* is associated with periodontal disease (disease of the gums).

Deltaproteobacteria also includes the genus ***Bdellovibrio***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, species of which are parasites of other gram-negative bacteria. *Bdellovibrio* invades the cells of the host bacterium, positioning itself in the periplasm, the space between the plasma membrane and the cell wall, feeding on the host’s proteins and polysaccharides. The infection is lethal for the host cells.

Another type of Deltaproteobacteria, **myxobacteria**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, lives in the soil, scavenging inorganic compounds. Motile and highly social, they interact with other bacteria within and outside their own group. They can form multicellular, macroscopic “**fruiting bodies**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}” ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_04_02_Myxobac)), structures that are still being studied by biologists and bacterial ecologists.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="footnote-ref2">[2](#footnote2){: data-type="footnote-link"}</sup> These bacteria can also form metabolically inactive **myxospores**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}.

### Epsilonproteobacteria

The smallest class of **Proteobacteria**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} is **Epsilonproteobacteria**{: data-type="term"}, which are gram-negative microaerophilic bacteria (meaning they only require small amounts of oxygen in their environment). Two clinically relevant genera of Epsilonproteobacteria are ***Campylobacter***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and ***Helicobacter***{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, both of which include human pathogens. *Campylobacter* can cause food poisoning that manifests as severe enteritis (inflammation in the small intestine). This condition, caused by the species *C. jejuni*, is rather common in developed countries, usually because of eating contaminated poultry products. Chickens often harbor *C. jejuni* in their gastrointestinal tract and feces, and their meat can become contaminated during processing.

Within the genus *Helicobacter,* the helical, flagellated bacterium *H. pylori* has been identified as a beneficial member of the stomach microbiota, but it is also the most common cause of chronic gastritis and ulcers of the stomach and duodenum ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_04_02_Hpylori)). Studies have also shown that *H. pylori* is linked to stomach cancer.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="footnote-ref3">[3](#footnote3){: data-type="footnote-link"}</sup> *H. pylori* is somewhat unusual in its ability to survive in the highly acidic environment of the stomach. It produces urease and other enzymes that modify its environment to make it less acidic.

### Key Concepts and Summary

* **Proteobacteria** is a phylum of gram-negative bacteria discovered by Carl Woese in the 1980s based on nucleotide sequence homology.
* Proteobacteria are further classified into the classes alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta- and epsilonproteobacteria, each class having separate orders, families, genera, and species.
* **Alphaproteobacteria** are **oligotrophs**. The taxa chlamydias and rickettsias are **obligate intracellular pathogens,** feeding on cells of host organisms; they are metabolically inactive outside of the host cell. Some Alphaproteobacteria can convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrites, making nitrogen usable by other forms of life.
* **Betaproteobacteria** are **eutrophs**. They include human pathogens of the genus *Neisseria* and the species *Bordetella pertussis*.
* **Gammaproteobacteria** are the largest and the most diverse group of Proteobacteria. Many are human pathogens that are aerobes or facultative anaerobes. Some Gammaproteobacteria are **enteric** bacteria that may be coliform or noncoliform. *Escherichia coli*, a member of Gammaproteobacteria, is perhaps the most studied bacterium.
* **Deltaproteobacteria** make up a small group able to reduce sulfate or elemental sulfur. Some are scavengers and form myxospores, with multicellular fruiting bodies.
* **Epsilonproteobacteria** make up the smallest group of Proteobacteria. The genera *Campylobacter* and *Helicobacter* are human pathogens.
