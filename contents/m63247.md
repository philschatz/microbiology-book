# About *Microbiology*

*Microbiology* is designed to cover the scope and sequence requirements for the single-semester Microbiology course for non-majors. The book presents the core concepts of microbiology with a focus on applications for careers in allied health. The pedagogical features of *Microbiology* make the material interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the career-application focus and scientific rigor inherent in the subject matter.

## Coverage and Scope

The scope and sequence of *Microbiology* has been developed and vetted with input from numerous instructors at institutions across the US. It is designed to meet the needs of most microbiology courses for non-majors and allied health students. In addition, we have also considered the needs of institutions that offer microbiology to a mixed audience of science majors and non-majors by frequently integrating topics that may not have obvious clinical relevance, such as environmental and applied microbiology and the history of science.

With these objectives in mind, the content of this textbook has been arranged in a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts. The opening chapters present an overview of the discipline, with individual chapters focusing on microscopy and cellular biology as well as each of the classifications of microorganisms. Students then explore the foundations of microbial biochemistry, metabolism, and genetics, topics that provide a basis for understanding the various means by which we can control and combat microbial growth. Beginning with Chapter 15, the focus turns to microbial pathogenicity, emphasizing how interactions between microbes and the human immune system contribute to human health and disease. The last several chapters of the text provide a survey of medical microbiology, presenting the characteristics of microbial diseases organized by body system.

A brief Table of Contents follows. While we have made every effort to align the Table of Contents with the needs of our audience, we recognize that some instructors may prefer to teach topics in a different order. A particular strength of *Microbiology* is that instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.

### ASM Recommended Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Microbiology Education

**PART 1: Concepts and Statements**

**Evolution**

1.  Cells, organelles (e.g., mitochondria and chloroplasts) and all major metabolic pathways evolved from early prokaryotic cells.
2.  Mutations and horizontal gene transfer, with the immense variety of microenvironments, have selected for a huge diversity of microorganisms.
3.  Human impact on the environment influences the evolution of microorganisms (e.g., emerging diseases and the selection of antibiotic resistance).
4.  The traditional concept of species is not readily applicable to microbes due to asexual reproduction and the frequent occurrence of horizontal gene transfer.
5.  The evolutionary relatedness of organisms is best reflected in phylogenetic trees.
{: data-number-style="arabic"}

**Cell Structure and Function**

1.  The structure and function of microorganisms have been revealed by the use of microscopy (including bright field, phase contrast, fluorescent, and electron).
2.  Bacteria have unique cell structures that can be targets for antibiotics, immunity and phage infection.
3.  Bacteria and Archaea have specialized structures (e.g., flagella, endospores, and pili) that often confer critical capabilities.
4.  While microscopic eukaryotes (for example, fungi, protozoa and algae) carry out some of the same processes as bacteria, many of the cellular properties are fundamentally different.
5.  The replication cycles of viruses (lytic and lysogenic) differ among viruses and are determined by their unique structures and genomes.
{: data-number-style="arabic" start="6"}

**Metabolic Pathways**

1.  Bacteria and Archaea exhibit extensive, and often unique, metabolic diversity (e.g., nitrogen fixation, methane production, anoxygenic photosynthesis).
2.  The interactions of microorganisms among themselves and with their environment are determined by their metabolic abilities (e.g., quorum sensing, oxygen consumption, nitrogen transformations).
3.  The survival and growth of any microorganism in a given environment depends on its metabolic characteristics.
4.  The growth of microorganisms can be controlled by physical, chemical, mechanical, or biological means.
{: data-number-style="arabic" start="11"}

**Information Flow and Genetics**

1.  Genetic variations can impact microbial functions (e.g., in biofilm formation, pathogenicity and drug resistance).
2.  Although the central dogma is universal in all cells, the processes of replication, transcription, and translation differ in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes.
3.  The regulation of gene expression is influenced by external and internal molecular cues and/or signals.
4.  The synthesis of viral genetic material and proteins is dependent on host cells.
5.  Cell genomes can be manipulated to alter cell function.
{: data-number-style="arabic" start="15"}

**Microbial Systems**

1.  Microorganisms are ubiquitous and live in diverse and dynamic ecosystems.
2.  Most bacteria in nature live in biofilm communities.
3.  Microorganisms and their environment interact with and modify each other.
4.  Microorganisms, cellular and viral, can interact with both human and nonhuman hosts in beneficial, neutral or detrimental ways.
{: data-number-style="arabic" start="20"}

**Impact of Microorganisms**

1.  Microbes are essential for life as we know it and the processes that support life (e.g., in biogeochemical cycles and plant and/or animal microbiota).
2.  Microorganisms provide essential models that give us fundamental knowledge about life processes.
3.  Humans utilize and harness microorganisms and their products.
4.  Because the true diversity of microbial life is largely unknown, its effects and potential benefits have not been fully explored.

## Engaging Feature Boxes

Throughout *Microbiology*, you will find features that engage students by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:

* **Clinical Focus.** Each chapter has a multi-part clinical case study that follows the story of a fictional patient. The case unfolds in several realistic episodes placed strategically throughout the chapter, each episode revealing new symptoms and clues about possible causes and diagnoses. The details of the case are directly related to the topics presented in the chapter, encouraging students to apply what they are learning to real-life scenarios. The final episode presents a Resolution that reveals the outcome of the case and unpacks the broader lessons to be learned.
* **Case in Point.** In addition to the Clinical Focus, many chapters also have one or more single-part case studies that serve to highlight the clinical relevance of a particular topic. These narratives are strategically placed directly after the topic of emphasis and generally conclude with a set of questions that challenge the reader to think critically about the case.
* **Micro Connections.** All chapters contain several Micro Connections feature boxes that highlight real-world applications of microbiology, drawing often-overlooked connections between microbiology and a wide range of other disciplines. While many of these connections involve medicine and healthcare, they also venture into domains such as environmental science, genetic engineering, and emerging technologies. Moreover, many Micro Connections boxes are related to current or recent events, further emphasizing the intersections between microbiology and everyday life.
* **Sigma Xi Eye on Ethics.** This unique feature, which appears in most chapters, explores an ethical issue related to chapter content. Developed in cooperation with the scientific research society Sigma Xi, each Eye on Ethics box presents students with a challenging ethical dilemma that arises at the intersection of science and healthcare. Often grounded in historical or current events, these short essays discuss multiple sides of an issue, posing questions that challenge the reader to contemplate the ethical principles that govern professionals in healthcare and the sciences.
* **Disease Profile.** This feature, which is exclusive to Chapters 21â€“26, highlights important connections between related diseases. Each box also includes a table cataloguing unique aspects of each disease, such as the causative agent, symptoms, portal of entry, mode of transmission, and treatment. These concise tables serve as a useful reference that students can use as a study aid.
* **Link to Learning.** This feature provides a brief introduction and a link to an online resource that students may use to further explore a topic presented in the chapter. Links typically lead to a website, interactive activity, or animation that students can investigate on their own.

Figure b is a drawing that labels the outside of the head as the capsid with the viral genome inside. The neck as the sheath and the legs as tail fibers.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_06_01_virusbac.jpg){: #OSC_Microbio_06_01_virusbac}

![A diagram of a large cell. The outside of the cell is a thin line labeled plasma membrane. A long projection outside of the plasma membrane is labeled flagellum. Shorter projections outside the membrane are labeled cilia. Just under the plasma membrane are lines labeled microtubules and microfilaments. The fluid inside the plasma membrane is labeled cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm are small dots labeled ribosomes. These dots are either floating in the cytoplasm or attached to a webbed membrane labeled rough endoplasmic reticulum. Some regions of the webbed membrane do not have dots; these regions of the membrane are called smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Other structures in the cytoplasm include an oval with a webbed line inside of it; this is labeled the mitochondrion. Spheres in the cytoplasm are labeled peroxisome and lysosome. A pancake stack of membranes is labeled golgi complex. Two short tubes are labeled centrosomes. A large sphere in the cell is labeled nucleus. The outer membrane of this sphere is the nuclear envelope. Holes in the nuclear envelope are called nuclear pores. A smaller sphere in the nucleus is labeled nucleolus.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_03_04_eukcell.jpg){: #OSC_Microbio_03_04_eukcell}

There are two layers of phospholipids making up the bilayer; each phospholipid layer has the sphere towards the outside of the bilayer and the two tails towards the inside of the bilayer. Embedded within the phospholipid bilayer are a variety of large proteins. Glycolipids have long carbohydrate chains (shown as a chain of hexagons) attached to a single phospholipid; the carbohydrates are always on the outside of the membrane. Glycoproteins have a long carbohydrate chain attached to a protein; the carbohydrates are on the outside of the membrane. The cytoskeleton is shown as a thin layer of line just under the inside of the phospholipid bilayer.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_03_04_EukPlasMem.jpg){: #OSC_Microbio_03_04_EukPlasMem}
