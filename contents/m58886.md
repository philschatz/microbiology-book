* Explain the mechanism by which superantigens effect unregulated T-cell activation

As explained in [Overview of Specific Adaptive Immunity](/m58884){: .target-chapter}, the antibodies involved in humoral immunity often bind pathogens and toxins before they can attach to and invade host cells. Thus, humoral immunity is primarily concerned with fighting pathogens in extracellular spaces. However, pathogens that have already gained entry to host cells are largely protected from the humoral antibody-mediated defenses. Cellular immunity, on the other hand, targets and eliminates **intracellular pathogens**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} through the actions of T lymphocytes, or T cells ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_18_03_Tcell)). T cells also play a more central role in orchestrating the overall adaptive immune response (humoral as well as cellular) along with the cellular defenses of innate immunity.

### T Cell Production and Maturation

T cells, like all other white blood cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity, are formed from multipotent **hematopoietic stem cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} (HSCs) in the bone marrow (see [\[link\]](/m58879#OSC_Microbio_17_05_Hematopo)). However, unlike the white blood cells of innate immunity, eventual T cells differentiate first into lymphoid stem cells that then become small, immature lymphocytes, sometimes called **lymphoblasts**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. The first steps of differentiation occur in the red marrow of bones ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_18_01_marrow)), after which immature T lymphocytes enter the bloodstream and travel to the **thymus**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} for the final steps of maturation ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_18_01_thymus)). Once in the thymus, the immature T lymphocytes are referred to as **thymocytes**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}.

The maturation of thymocytes within the thymus can be divided into tree critical steps of positive and negative selection, collectively referred to as **thymic selection**{: data-type="term"}. The first step of thymic selection occurs in the cortex of the thymus and involves the development of a functional **T-cell receptor (TCR)**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} that is required for activation by APCs. Thymocytes with defective TCRs are removed by negative selection through the induction of **apoptosis**{: data-type="term"} (programmed controlled cell death). The second step of thymic selection also occurs in the cortex and involves the positive selection of thymocytes that will interact appropriately with MHC molecules. Thymocytes that can interact appropriately with MHC molecules receive a positive stimulation that moves them further through the process of maturation, whereas thymocytes that do not interact appropriately are not stimulated and are eliminated by **apoptosis**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. The third and final step of thymic selection occurs in both the cortex and medulla and involves **negative selection**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} to remove **self-reacting thymocytes**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, those that react to self-antigens, by apoptosis. This final step is sometimes referred to as **central tolerance**{: data-type="term"} because it prevents self-reacting T cells from reaching the bloodstream and potentially causing **autoimmune disease**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, which occurs when the immune system attacks healthy “self” cells.

Despite central tolerance, some self-reactive T cells generally escape the thymus and enter the peripheral bloodstream. Therefore, a second line of defense called **peripheral tolerance**{: data-type="term"} is needed to protect against autoimmune disease. Peripheral tolerance involves mechanisms of **anergy**{: data-type="term"} and inhibition of self-reactive T cells by **regulatory T cells**{: data-type="term"}. Anergy refers to a state of nonresponsiveness to antigen stimulation. In the case of self-reactive T cells that escape the thymus, lack of an essential **co-stimulatory signal**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} required for activation causes anergy and prevents autoimmune activation. Regulatory T cells participate in peripheral tolerance by inhibiting the activation and function of self-reactive T cells and by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines.

It is not completely understood what events specifically direct maturation of thymocytes into regulatory T cells. Current theories suggest the critical events may occur during the third step of thymic selection, when most self-reactive T cells are eliminated. Regulatory T cells may receive a unique signal that is below the threshold required to target them for negative selection and apoptosis. Consequently, these cells continue to mature and then exit the thymus, armed to inhibit the activation of self-reactive T cells.

It has been estimated that the three steps of thymic selection eliminate 98% of thymocytes. The remaining 2% that exit the thymus migrate through the bloodstream and **lymphatic system**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} to sites of secondary lymphoid organs/tissues, such as the **lymph nodes**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, **spleen**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, and **tonsils**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_18_01_thymus)), where they await activation through the presentation of specific antigens by APCs. Until they are activated, they are known as **mature naïve T cells**{: data-type="term"}.

### Classes of T Cells

T cells can be categorized into three distinct classes: **helper T cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, regulatory T cells, and **cytotoxic T cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. These classes are differentiated based on their expression of certain surface molecules, their mode of activation, and their functional roles in adaptive immunity ([\[link\]](#fs-id1167662906208)).

All T cells produce **cluster of differentiation (CD) molecules**{: data-type="term"}, cell surface glycoproteins that can be used to identify and distinguish between the various types of white blood cells. Although T cells can produce a variety of CD molecules, **CD4**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and **CD8**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} are the two most important used for differentiation of the classes. Helper T cells and regulatory T cells are characterized by the expression of CD4 on their surface, whereas cytotoxic T cells are characterized by the expression of CD8.

Classes of T cells can also be distinguished by the specific MHC molecules and APCs with which they interact for activation. Helper T cells and regulatory T cells can only be activated by APCs presenting antigens associated with **MHC II**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. In contrast, cytotoxic T cells recognize antigens presented in association with **MHC I**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, either by APCs or by nucleated cells infected with an intracellular pathogen.

The different classes of T cells also play different functional roles in the immune system. **Helper T cells**{: data-type="term"} serve as the central orchestrators that help activate and direct functions of humoral and cellular immunity. In addition, helper T cells enhance the pathogen-killing functions of **macrophages**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and **NK cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} of innate immunity. In contrast, the primary role of regulatory T cells is to prevent undesirable and potentially damaging immune responses. Their role in **peripheral tolerance**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, for example, protects against **autoimmune disorders**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, as discussed earlier. Finally, **cytotoxic T cells**{: data-type="term"} are the primary effector cells for cellular immunity. They recognize and target cells that have been infected by **intracellular pathogens**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, destroying infected cells along with the pathogens inside.

### T-Cell Receptors

For both helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, activation is a complex process that requires the interactions of multiple molecules and exposure to cytokines. The **T-cell receptor (TCR)**{: data-type="term"} is involved in the first step of pathogen epitope recognition during the activation process.

The TCR comes from the same receptor family as the antibodies IgD and IgM, the antigen receptors on the B cell membrane surface, and thus shares common structural elements. Similar to antibodies, the TCR has a **variable region**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and a **constant region**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, and the variable region provides the antigen-binding site ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_18_03_TCR)). However, the structure of TCR is smaller and less complex than the immunoglobulin molecules ([\[link\]](/m58884#OSC_Microbio_18_04_ABstruct)). Whereas immunoglobulins have four peptide chains and Y-shaped structures, the TCR consists of just two peptide chains (α and β chains), both of which span the cytoplasmic membrane of the T cell.

TCRs are epitope-specific, and it has been estimated that 25 million T cells with unique epitope-binding TCRs are required to protect an individual against a wide range of microbial pathogens. Because the human genome only contains about 25,000 genes, we know that each specific TCR cannot be encoded by its own set of genes. This raises the question of how such a vast population of T cells with millions of specific TCRs can be achieved. The answer is a process called **genetic rearrangement**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, which occurs in the thymus during the first step of **thymic selection**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}.

The genes that code for the variable regions of the TCR are divided into distinct gene segments called **variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. The genes segments associated with the α chain of the TCR consist 70 or more different V<sub>α</sub> segments and 61 different J<sub>α</sub> segments. The gene segments associated with the β chain of the TCR consist of 52 different V<sub>β</sub> segments, two different D<sub>β</sub> segments, and 13 different J<sub>β</sub> segments. During the development of the functional TCR in the thymus, genetic rearrangement in a T cell brings together one V<sub>α</sub> segment and one J<sub>α</sub> segment to code for the variable region of the α chain. Similarly, genetic rearrangement brings one of the V<sub>β</sub> segments together with one of the D<sub>β</sub> segments and one of thetJ<sub>β</sub> segments to code for the variable region of the β chain. All the possible combinations of rearrangements between different segments of V, D, and J provide the genetic diversity required to produce millions of TCRs with unique epitope-specific variable regions.

### Activation and Differentiation of Helper T Cells

Helper T cells can only be activated by **APCs**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} presenting processed **foreign epitopes**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} in association with **MHC II**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. The first step in the activation process is **TCR**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} recognition of the specific foreign epitope presented within the MHC II **antigen-binding cleft**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. The second step involves the interaction of **CD4**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} on the helper T cell with a region of the MHC II molecule separate from the antigen-binding cleft. This second interaction anchors the MHC II-TCR complex and ensures that the helper T cell is recognizing both the foreign (“nonself”) epitope and “self” antigen of the APC; both recognitions are required for activation of the cell. In the third step, the APC and T cell secrete **cytokines**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} that activate the helper T cell. The activated helper T cell then proliferates, dividing by mitosis to produce clonal naïve helper T cells that differentiate into subtypes with different functions ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_18_03_Tcellact)).

 ![A native helper T cells binds to an antigen extracted from a pathogen sitting on the MCH Class II protein of an antigen presenting cell (dendritic cell). The portion of the helper T cell that binds is the T cell receptor and is stabilized by CD4. After this binding the helper T cell is activated and can become TH1 cell; TH2 cell or memory helper T cell.](../resources/OSC_Microbio_18_03_Tcellact.jpg "This illustration depicts the activation of a na&#xEF;ve (unactivated) helper T cell by an antigen-presenting cell and the subsequent proliferation and differentiation of the activated T cell into different subtypes."){: #OSC_Microbio_18_03_Tcellact}

Activated helper T cells can differentiate into one of four distinct subtypes, summarized in [\[link\]](#fs-id1167658047912). The differentiation process is directed by APC-secreted **cytokines**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. Depending on which APC-secreted cytokines interact with an activated helper T cell, the cell may differentiate into a T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) cell, a T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) cell, or a memory helper T cell. The two types of helper T cells are relatively short-lived **effector cells**{: data-type="term"}, meaning that they perform various functions of the immediate immune response. In contrast, **memory helper T cells**{: data-type="term"} are relatively long lived; they are programmed to “remember” a specific antigen or epitope in order to mount a rapid, strong, **secondary response**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} to subsequent exposures.

**T<sub>H</sub>1 cells**{: data-type="term"} secrete their own cytokines that are involved in stimulating and orchestrating other cells involved in adaptive and innate immunity. For example, they stimulate cytotoxic T cells, enhancing their killing of infected cells and promoting differentiation into **memory cytotoxic T cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. T<sub>H</sub>1 cells also stimulate **macrophages**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and **neutrophils**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} to become more effective in their killing of intracellular bacteria. They can also stimulate **NK cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} to become more effective at killing target cells.

**T<sub>H</sub>2 cells**{: data-type="term"} play an important role in orchestrating the humoral immune response through their secretion of **cytokines**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} that activate **B cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and direct B cell differentiation and **antibody production**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. Various cytokines produced by T<sub>H</sub>2 cells orchestrate **antibody class switching**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, which allows B cells to switch between the production of IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE as needed to carry out specific antibody functions and to provide pathogen-specific humoral immune responses.

A third subtype of helper T cells called **T<sub>H</sub>17 cells**{: data-type="term"} was discovered through observations that immunity to some infections is not associated with T<sub>H</sub>1 or T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and the cytokines they produce appear to be specifically responsible for the body’s defense against chronic mucocutaneous infections. Patients who lack sufficient T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in the mucosa (e.g., HIV patients) may be more susceptible to bacteremia and gastrointestinal infections.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="footnote-ref1">[1](#footnote1){: data-type="footnote-link"}</sup>

### Activation and Differentiation of Cytotoxic T Cells

Cytotoxic T cells (also referred to as **cytotoxic T lymphocytes**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, or CTLs) are activated by APCs in a three-step process similar to that of helper T cells. The key difference is that the **activation of cytotoxic T cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} involves recognition of an antigen presented with MHC I (as opposed to MHC II) and interaction of CD8 (as opposed to CD4) with the receptor complex. After the successful co-recognition of foreign epitope and self-antigen, the production of **cytokines**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} by the APC and the cytotoxic T cell activate **clonal proliferation**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and differentiation. Activated cytotoxic T cells can differentiate into effector cytotoxic T cells that target pathogens for destruction or **memory cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} that are ready to respond to subsequent exposures.

As noted, proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic T cells is also stimulated by cytokines secreted from T<sub>H</sub>1 cells activated by the same foreign epitope. The **co-stimulation**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} that comes from these T<sub>H</sub>1 cells is provided by secreted cytokines. Although it is possible for activation of cytotoxic T cells to occur without stimulation from T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, the activation is not as effective or long-lasting.

Once activated, cytotoxic T cells serve as the effector cells of cellular immunity, recognizing and kill cells infected with **intracellular pathogens**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} through a mechanism very similar to that of **NK cells**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. However, whereas NK cells recognize nonspecific signals of cell stress or abnormality, cytotoxic T cells recognize infected cells through antigen presentation of pathogen-specific epitopes associated with **MHC I**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. Once an infected cell is recognized, the TCR of the cytotoxic T cell binds to the epitope and releases **perforin**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} and **granzymes**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} that destroy the infected cell ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_18_03_Tprolif)). Perforin is a protein that creates pores in the target cell, and **granzymes**{: data-type="term"} are proteases that enter the pores and induce **apoptosis**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. This mechanism of **programmed cell death**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} is a controlled and efficient means of destroying and removing infected cells without releasing the pathogens inside to infect neighboring cells, as might occur if the infected cells were simply lysed.

### Superantigens and Unregulated Activation of T Cells

When T cell activation is controlled and regulated, the result is a protective response that is effective in combating infections. However, if T cell activation is unregulated and excessive, the result can be a life-threatening. Certain bacterial and viral pathogens produce toxins known as **superantigens**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} (see [Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens](/m58868){: .target-chapter}) that can trigger such an unregulated response. Known bacterial superantigens include **toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, **staphylococcal enterotoxins**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, **streptococcal pyrogenic toxins**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, **streptococcal superantigen**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, and the **streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. Viruses known to produce superantigens include **Epstein-Barr virus**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} (human herpesvirus 4), **cytomegalovirus**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} (human herpesvirus 5), and others.

The mechanism of T cell activation by superantigens involves their simultaneous binding to **MHC II**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} molecules of APCs and the variable region of the **TCR**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} β chain. This binding occurs outside of the antigen-binding cleft of MHC II, so the superantigen will bridge together and activate MHC II and TCR without specific foreign epitope recognition ([\[link\]](#OSC_Microbio_18_03_SuperAntig)). The result is an excessive, uncontrolled release of cytokines, often called a **cytokine storm**{: data-type="term"}, which stimulates an excessive inflammatory response. This can lead to a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, shock, multi-organ failure, and potentially, death.

(b) The macrophage in this figure is presenting a superantigen that is not recognized by the TCR of the T cell, yet the superantigen still is able to bridge and bind the MHC II and TCR molecules. This nonspecific, uncontrolled activation of the T cell results in an excessive release of cytokines that activate other T cells and cause excessive inflammation.

Melissa, an otherwise healthy 22-year-old woman, is brought to the emergency room by her concerned boyfriend. She complains of a sudden onset of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle aches. In her initial interview, she tells the attending physician that she is on hormonal birth control and also is two days into the menstruation portion of her cycle. She is on no other medications and is not abusing any drugs or alcohol. She is not a smoker. She is not diabetic and does not currently have an infection of any kind to her knowledge.

While waiting in the emergency room, Melissa’s blood pressure begins to drop dramatically and her mental state deteriorates to general confusion. The physician believes she is likely suffering from **toxic shock syndrome (TSS)**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}. TSS is caused by the toxin TSST-1, a superantigen associated with *Staphylococcus aureus*, and improper tampon use is a common cause of infections leading to TSS. The superantigen inappropriately stimulates widespread T cell activation and excessive cytokine release, resulting in a massive and systemic inflammatory response that can be fatal.

Vaginal or cervical swabs may be taken to confirm the presence of the microbe, but these tests are not critical to perform based on Melissa’s symptoms and medical history. The physician prescribes rehydration, supportive therapy, and antibiotics to stem the bacterial infection. She also prescribes drugs to increase Melissa’s blood pressure. Melissa spends three days in the hospital undergoing treatment; in addition, her kidney function is monitored because of the high risk of kidney failure associated with TSS. After 72 hours, Melissa is well enough to be discharged to continue her recovery at home.

Olivia’s swollen lymph nodes, abdomen, and spleen suggest a strong immune response to a systemic infection in progress. In addition, little Olivia is reluctant to turn her head and appears to be experiencing severe neck pain. The physician orders a complete blood count, blood culture, and lumbar puncture. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained appears cloudy and is further evaluated by Gram stain assessment and culturing for potential bacterial pathogens. The complete blood count indicates elevated numbers of white blood cells in Olivia’s bloodstream. The white blood cell increases are recorded at 28.5 K/µL (normal range: 6.0–17.5 K/µL). The neutrophil percentage was recorded as 60% (normal range: 23–45%). Glucose levels in the CSF were registered at 30 mg/100 mL (normal range: 50–80 mg/100 mL). The WBC count in the CSF was 1,163/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal range: 5–20/mm<sup>3</sup>).

### Key Concepts and Summary

* Immature T lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow and travel to the thymus for maturation.
* **Thymic selection** is a three-step process of negative and positive selection that determines which T cells will mature and exit the thymus into the peripheral bloodstream.
* **Central tolerance** involves negative selection of self-reactive T cells in the thymus, and **peripheral tolerance** involves **anergy** and **regulatory T cells** that prevent self-reactive immune responses and autoimmunity.
* The **TCR** is similar in structure to immunoglobulins, but less complex. Millions of unique epitope-binding TCRs are encoded through a process of genetic rearrangement of V, D, and J gene segments.
* T cells can be divided into three classes—**helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells,** and **regulatory T cells—**based on their expression of CD4 or CD8, the MHC molecules with which they interact for activation, and their respective functions.
* Activated helper T cells differentiate into **T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, T<sub>H</sub>17**, or **memory T cell subtypes**. Differentiation is directed by the specific cytokines to which they are exposed. T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, and T<sub>H</sub>17 perform different functions related to stimulation of adaptive and innate immune defenses. Memory T cells are long-lived cells that can respond quickly to secondary exposures.
* Once activated, cytotoxic T cells target and kill cells infected with intracellular pathogens. Killing requires recognition of specific pathogen epitopes presented on the cell surface using MHC I molecules. Killing is mediated by **perforin** and **granzymes** that induce apoptosis.
* **Superantigens** are bacterial or viral proteins that cause a nonspecific activation of helper T cells, leading to an excessive release of cytokines (**cytokine storm**) and a systemic, potentially fatal inflammatory response.
